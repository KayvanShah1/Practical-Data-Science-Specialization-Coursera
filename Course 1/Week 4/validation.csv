__label__1 "i really like this dress a lot . the material is soft and comfortable . it is clingy but not in a bad way . the design can camouflage some figure problems . i thought it looked better with a belt so i added a skinny beige/pink belt which worked great . ca n't say enough about how comfortable this dress is ."
__label__-1 "i bought this online so did n't realize that the fabric at the bottom is very very stiff . i was expecting something silky or at least on the softer and more moveable side . the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt . that being the case it kind of juts out in weird places . the sweater part is very nice but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture . the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o"
__label__0 "this sweater has potential but it was n't right for me . the collar is n't flattering on me ... too thick and my shoulders are already broad . my waist is high so i need a longer look . the color is true to size but it 's s little see through ... dark bra shows through ."
__label__-1 "if you are going for a ridiculously high priced ugly sweater contest this is the one for you . i normally like clothing with some character and juxtaposition but this one did not do it for me . i can not imagine the collar fitting right or flattering anyone and the mixed layers end up making it look cheap rather than trendy ."
__label__0 "i ordered this top online in two colors and kept the berry color . i liked it while trying it on . when i wore it an entire day the top just did n't look that good . it was n't flattering and it focused on the bad areas despite being loose fitting . it did n't seem very flattering . i wore it for one day and am not happy with my purchase . i wish i could send it back but i already wore it . the fit just is n't very flattering . it is loose but focuses on the curves not in a good way if you are curvy ."
__label__-1 "the minute i put this sweater on i could n't wait to take it off . it was way too scratchy for me . so for those with any type of sensitivity to wool this is not the sweater for you . otherwise i thought the design was quite cute ."
__label__-1 "i wanted so much to love this dress but unfortunately the fit was so poor i had to return it . the color of the dress ( green ) was lovely and i liked the fabric and the overall design very much . i read the reviews and decided to order an extra small petite given that reviewers said the dress ran large ; but even at that size the dress was too large especially around the hips ( which for someone with an hourglass figure is saying a lot ! ) . the extra fabric around the hips belled out some making"
__label__1 "i ordered this skirt online in a size 8 but returned for a 10 so it could sit a bit lower . the fabric is so beautiful and a bit heavier so it can be worn all year long . so glad i made this purchase ."
__label__1 "love love love this dress . fits like a glove . beautiful details . amazing quality . i 'm so happy with this dress and know i 'll have it for years . : )"
__label__0 "i really liked the color and style of this dress but the proportions were off . the top was too small and the waist was too large . if you are more uniform in size/shape and less of an hourglass this dress may be perfect for you !"
__label__1 "i gave this in her brighter rose colored print and love it ! i get many compliments on this top ! i did size up from my usual small to a medium to accommodate the girls : )"
__label__-1 "oh what a disappointment ! i was looking forward to wearing this as a layering piece with the shawl cardigan . the material lacks serious quality and it was ripped on the seam . so back it goes . and i am flabbergasted at the price retailer is charging almost $ 60 for this top !"
__label__1 "i bought these in my usual size 28 and they were much too loose so i returned them . i definitely need a 27 ( 39 inch hips 33 low waist 31 waist ) . i have lost a few pounds but i am usually a size 4-6 in pants . even loose i can see the pants are flattering and long enough for my leggy 5 ' 9 frame . they are still cropped but i would say look much the same as on the model . if you are shorter i think the petite option would be necessary to achieve a cropped look . the material is not bright white wi"
__label__0 "note : if you have a large chest the seams hit in an unflattering spot . nice shirt just not great for the price ."

__label__1 "this is a great dress that looks better in reality than it shows on the website . the style is very flattering fitting snug at the waist with just the right amount of flare . i am 132 pounds 34dd and i bought a size 8 and it fit great . the material is soft and flowing and the cut was true to size for me . the first time i wore it a woman walked across the restaurant to tell me how much she loved my dress . this one is a keeper ."
__label__1 "i 'm 5 ' 7 with a 36 b bra size and a size 4 fit perfectly and could not have been more comfortable . one big plus for me is that it is virtually wrinkle free . i purchased the orange which is a lovely muted orange not neon or too bright and received multiple compliments when i wore it to work the first time ."
__label__-1 "this dress was adorable & fit great ! regrettably i had to return it since it was n't lined ."
__label__-1 "regretfully this dress is on its way back for an exchange . the dresss is beautiful and fits true to size i ordered it in both colors however the black has a defect in the lace right on the front of the dress and the white was tearing in a few spots under the arms and on the bottom . again the dress is so pretty and i am hoping retailer will find me one without bunching pulls or tears for an exchange but i ca n't pay 130 for a dress that is already torn ."
__label__1 "this top is just darling ! the body of the top is lightweight sweatshirt type material that 's dyed to appear well used . the ruffling along the bottom is color coordinated and beautifully textured . great to wear with leggings ! the back hangs lower than the front so your rear will be covered . extremely comfortable machine washable . an unexpectedly nicer than it looks online garment . i bought the blue version which looks more lavender irl ."
__label__0 "i was disappointed with this jumpsuit . when i first saw it in the store i thought i was going to love it . when i tried it on the first issue is the fabric is too sheer . i could completely see the outline of my underwear and bra . it also runs way too big ! i know the bottom is supposed to be loose and flowy but the waist needs to be more tapered to off set that and it 's so baggy . the arm holes are also cut very low so when you lift your arms you can see most of your bra on the sides i wante"
__label__1 "super soft and cute . the buttons add a nice touch . the color depicted online gave me pause but when i saw it in the store it was more of a blue than that what you see in pic . great investment . beautiful sweater . 34c 65 135 and the small is perfect ."
__label__1 "this top is absolutely adorable fits small on top and then flares out a bit as shown . i bought it months ago and have n't worn it yet though . might try it with white jeans as shown ."
__label__1 "the fit in the skirt is flexible because the waist is elastic and the shape is flattering it does n't stick out too far over the butt . the brocade texture and gold and blue colors are very fall . looking forward to wearing this with boots and tights . i 'm usually either a large or medium in skirts and i went for a medium in this one ."
__label__0 "i like this top but unfortunately i will be returning . it 's way too long . the color is pretty as is the design minus the length . it makes it look frumpy . maybe if they offered it in petite or if you 're taller it would work for you ."
__label__-1 "this one did n't work for me . there is no zipper you climb into it from the very large neck hole . it was very low cut and the shoulders kept sliding off but the bottom half fit snug . the tie and waist seam did n't hit at my waist but the largest part of my middle . i tried other belts and it was n't much better . the fabric and print were great . i love jumpers but this one went back ."
__label__0 "beautiful sweater coat ! love that is easy to pop on & head out . i did have to go to a seamstress and have the button moved as it was to large and boxy around my waist area ."
__label__0 "this is a very cute dress . it was perfect before i washed it . the problems i had after washing it was the outer cotton layer of the dress shrunk length wise while the inside black lining did not so the black lining peeks out a good inch or two . and since the dress is shorter i ca n't really wear it without using biker shorts especially for the back of the dress since it 's shorter there and if i bent over you could see everything . i 'm so disappointed in the quality because it is a very cute ver"
__label__0 "i received this dress today for a june wedding . i was so excited about it and the quality is beautiful but unfortunately i am going to have to return it . it runs very big . i normally like to wear items a bit bigger/baggier but with this dress it needs to be tight on the sides . bummer : ("

__label__-1 "review title says almost all . add to that that it is age appropriate unlike other kedia dresses for the very young . just too cute for words . i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart . this however on an older woman looks ridiculous . i would have liked it for those 9 months but even then it would cover quadruplets !"
__label__-1 "i do n't normally review my purchases but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made i could n't help myself but to post a review . the neck line is n't even hemmed down so it flaps up . the material is thin and feel cheap . this dress isnt even worth $ 20 in my opinion . i was expecting a well made good quality dress for the high price tag ."
__label__1 "this is the most beautiful dress ever ! i 'm very short and petite with an hourglass figure and a rather large chest . this dress feels like it was made for me . i often have a difficult time finding a dress that flatters my figure and is slimming . i was shocked that it was even a little roomy in the chest . the cut is so beautiful and it is very well made . while the lining might be too short for tall girls being only 51 the lining is perfect . the length in the back is just a teeny bit too long so"
__label__-1 "as soon as i saw this dress i absolutely fell in love with it . when i got it i noticed it was slightly small but figured i could deal with it . i was packing for my vacation and tried it on again just last night and i noticed the bow is coming off the back . i could fix it but honestly a dress should n't start falling apart before you even wear it . it 's cut on the small side . wish i tried the larger one but now it 's sold out . and i was kind of disappointed there were no pockets as pictured . i"

__label__0 "i thought this was such a beautiful cardigan from the online photos . i ordered it in the small size but the fit is strange . the arms and wrist cuffs are so large it can not be pushed up to stay out of the way for things i would like to do when wearing it ( i 'm a teacher and my classroom is that kind of environment ) . i was also confused by the front collar ribbing and how it was supposed to lay - open folded over partly folded over - it just did n't seem to have a particular style to this area ."
__label__0 "what a huge dissippointment when this arrived home ..... the sleeves are very long and very boxy ... i have no idea the condition of this on store but came with damages on sleeves also we can tell that was something wrong and i was surprise that retailer sent me something like that i 'm a customer here for a very long time ! ! ! ! dissipointed ! ! ! ! ; ("

__label__-1 "i 've purchased pilcro jeans in the past and they 've held up great . unfortunately the material used for this particular jean is a far far cry from what it used to be . the thighs of these jeans start pilling ( yes pilling ! ) after just a few wears . i 've never had jeans do this -- whatever denim blend they are using is a complete disaster . do n't buy these -- you will be very disappointed ."
__label__-1 "this could seriously fit a large and it 's an xs . so frustrating ! ! this is the fourth retailer dress that is ordered that is just enormous . i get the whole loose fit style but seriously ? ? ? you 've taken it to a whole new level retailer ! ! ! another trip to the store to return another item . a complete waste of my time . ugh ."
__label__0 "i should have paid more attention to the reviews of this sweater before ordering . although the material looks soft and cozy in the photo it 's very scratchy and uncomfortable . i was also hoping the opening of the collar would be a little wider which would have been more flattering on me . i never wear turtlenecks of any kind so i took a chance on this . i 'm sure others will look fabulous in this sweater and may be happy with it if they do n't mind the texture . i 'm sending it back ."
__label__-1 "the shape is awkward too loose not flattering . my body just disappears under all the fabric and the bird print was n't as cute as online . returning this one ."
__label__0 "i decided to take advantage of the free shipping despite seeing no reviews yet . i received the dress today and it is exactly as pictured only about 3 inches shorter . i am usually between an xs and s but chose the xs because of late everything i seem to order is huge . this was an exception and i could have ordered the s. color was as pictured a nice green . fabric was a gauzy cotton . the dress was just alright . nothing special to warrant the price tag . it felt like a little girl 's dress on me"
__label__0 "this dress has a beautiful color and design . however it runs too big . i 'm usually between size 2 or 4 on antropologie 's cloths . i had to size down to size 0 to get a more fitted look like the model ."
__label__0 "this picture does not do this skirt justice . it is gorgeous . however the waist was so small that the sequins dug into my waist making me think of a medieval torture device . unfortunately it was the largest size so i ca n't size up . i 'm 4'11 so the length was perfect - it came to right above my knees . i love the skirt so much that i 'm considering liposuction ."
__label__-1 "the fit of this sweater did not flatter my body-type . the top half did not fit well ; the armpit area was loose fitting and the neckline was awkward ."

__label__1 "this sweater is a perfect transition piece ! the material is really soft . while it has the shape of a poncho it is cut nicely and does n't make you look like a big blob ."
__label__0 "this cute dress was very nice on . however my only reservations were the thickness in the arm sleeves . the dress has this thick curtain like material on the sleeves that seemed to big and cut way to wide for my skinny arms . i thought about bringing this to the tailor but i feel it would be a lot of work and the bulkiness of the arms would just be the same . other than that the colors and dress are beautiful ."
__label__0 "i do n't think they are an easy fit cut they are more like skinny jeans . as i was looking for something more relaxed i decided to return them . the quality of the material is good the color is nice ."
__label__0 "i got this in black . will probably get in the purple print too . the purple is a bit more casual while the black can be work appropriate if with a nice top . very comfy ."
__label__-1 "the top i received was large really long in length pockets in the front along the seam and lots of volume in the back without any princess seams to give it shape . the id # 's matched but that 's about it . returned !"
__label__1 "love this sweater ! not too long or bulky true to size . the fabric is super soft great quality !"
__label__-1 "runs extremely large . i got an xs and am 5 ' 4 115lbs and this would have fit someone who typically wears a size 10-14 and is 5 ' 6 and above . very disappointed with the size . the quality of the fabric was n't great either . i wanted it to work so bad but just did n't !"
__label__0 "i have purchased many different styles of pilcro jeans and have loved them all ! ! ! these unfortunately i do not like . i think they run large and the fit just blah . the waist gapped and kinda had a mom jean look . i felt the quality was also not up to standard for this brand ."

__label__1 "this shirt is so comfortable and looks very nice with jeans or work pants . it 's a great shirt !"
__label__-1 "i was very disappointed by the fit of this top . it is quite short ( especially in the back ) and very wide . i did not find it flattering . on a positive note the fabric is nice and thick - very warm layering piece for fall . for sizing reference i 'm 5 ' 5 '' 122 lbs and took my usual size xs ."
__label__-1 "my v-shape figure ( broad shoulder narrow hips waist not well defined ) looked completely square in this . not flattering at all . perhaps better for other figures ."

__label__0 "these pants are adorable as pajamas or maybe something very casual to wear to the beach but they honestly do not seem like something that a grown woman would wear in public . they are good quality and fit nicely but i feel like if you 're over 20 they 're not really flattering or especially appropriate ."
__label__-1 "loved the fit and colors but the fabric is very thin and see-thru . i tried a nude cami underneath and the cami was completely visible . it did not look appropriate for anything that i wanted to wear the top to ."
__label__1 "the fit and style of this dress are beautiful . it 's a bouncy fabric that is light and comfortable . i really wanted to love it but the color just did n't work for me . the pictures make it look like it 's a nice cream color but it 's very tan and i ca n't pull it off with my coloring ."
__label__-1 "this is a cute dress but not for me . 1. i think it runs very small 2. it is super textured so if you do n't want to add bulk ( aka pounds ) to your frame this probably is n't for you . it 's too bad it 's online only because i would have benefitted from trying this on first . i 'm sure it 's probably adorable on smaller thinner people . unfortunately mine is going back ."
__label__0 "uncertain about sizing i got both the 4 & the 6 ... both made me look like a no-asser : ( neither fit quite right in the leg . both hit at a weird point in my calf not cute-short just off . ( i 'm 5 ' 8 and 125 # ) to quote my husband nope . not feeling these . that said they feel great on seem to be made well but are heading back to an retailer near you : ( sigh . the quest continues : )"

__label__1 "these cords are a great skinny fit . they seem true to size for me and look great on . only issue i would have is the color says navy but they are more of a deep purple-ish color . i had to recheck my order because they definitely are n't navy .... but i 'm keeping them because the fit is awesome ."
__label__-1 "i am floored by the amount of positive reviews on this dress ! when i received it it looked nothing like it does on the model . the bottom looked like dirty sand and was completely wrinkled . if you have anything above a c cup the top looks completely unflattering . i looked so top heavy in this dress ! definitely not worth the price . so disappointed ."
__label__0 "ordered this online in the pinkish color . the material is a little thin . as a busty curvy lady this one just did n't sit right ran a tad large and looked boxy . if you have a thinner frame may be a better look for you . detailing is nice ."
__label__1 "this hoodie is just what i had hoped it would be ... it is super soft comfortably loose but with the tie bottom hugging the hips and low v-neck - it 's just the right amount of sexy . it will be my go-to this fall and winter !"
__label__-1 "i purchased these pants while on vacation because i thought they 'd be the perfect addition to my comfy travel wardrobe . on my second wear i happened to be on a long-haul flight when the entire side seam split about a food long on my upper outer thigh . luckily i 'd packed a back-up dress . the pants were n't tight at all but the seams wre n't strong enough to handle a little pressure from sitting i guess . poor construction . i would not recommend these ."
__label__0 "this is a relatively cute top when you try it on . however i do n't think it will hold it 's shape after even just 1 wear . it also does n't seem like you could wash it without ruining it ( like a shirt form a 'throw-away ' cheap clothing store ) . i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high % viscose - meaning it wo n't last long at all . i 'm returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is ."
__label__0 "i like the idea of the pullover . the quality of is nice ; the material is very soft and feels pleasant to the touch . i expected this sweater to be more flattering though . it is true to size but the length is strange . it seems a bit too long yet is too short to look like a longer tunic . or maybe the waistline is a little low ... whatever it is it makes me look like i have short legs . also the collar wo n't stay down the way it is shown in the picture . but it may work better for someone wi"
__label__0 "the concept of this top is edgy for a sweatshirt fabric . i think it works better on a thin frame instead of my curvy frame . although i appreciate the design it did not work for me ."
__label__1 "this poncho is lovely . i found it fits perfectly . im 5 ' 4 125 and got the xs/s .. just long enough ( loke jacket length ) and the hood doesnt add extra weight ( doesnt drag it down the back ) . arm holes are approriate size . very cool piece for any weather layering ."
__label__-1 "this blouse is beautiful and i saw someone wearing it and she looked great . i went and bought this to wear for a holiday party and it is not for people with any sort of chest ! it looked ridiculous on me as the pleats started right at the bra line and caused the blouse to tent out in both directions ! however - looks super cute on those more on the flat-chested side !"
__label__1 "i 'm 5 ' 5 145lbs and i 'm usually a small/medium depending on the vendor . i bought this shirt in a red medium and love it . yes it 's boxy and a little big but lays nicely and i think it 's meant to be a bit big . i 've worn a black cami underneath and the shoulder hangs off a little to the side giving a little extra sexy look to it . this shirt washes well per instructions did n't shrink or loose it 's shape and i 've washed it three times now . i 've had many compliments on how cute this shirt is love"
__label__1 "this cardigan is utterly gorgeous . way prettier on than i feared . my only issue is it felt a little itchy in the arms and so i finally looked closely at the tag . the tag says the * back * section ( which looks exactly like the weave on the arms ) has a measly 5 % wool snuck into the fabric content . why retailer ? why wool ? i am so sensitive to it ! my eyes have been demon red and itchy all day classic symptoms that led to my getting rid of anything in my wardrobe with wool in it . now i have a problem"
__label__0 "i tried this on in the store in the xs size . the pattern is striking and really makes you think of all the things you love about fall . having said that i did not buy it and probably wo n't unless i find it on the sale rack later . it is really more of a poncho than a sweater . the fit is very oversize through the body and i tried the xs size . it is also fairly cropped on me as i am tall . i would only wear it with a shirt underneath . the sleeves and not attached to the shoulder but start further do"
__label__0 "boxy unflattering and large . i 'm 5 ' 2 '' and a curvy 135 pounds . this top ( size s ) swallowed me had no shape and the material did n't feel great either . i would n't even purchase it on sale -- there are other graphic tees that are much nicer . i 'll be sticking to splendid and sundry ."
__label__1 "i love this dress ! it is so much fun to wear to the beach or out to lunch ! the arm holes are a little large so i wear s tank underneath !"
__label__1 "i bought this dress for summer celebrations . the fabric is beautiful and the colors are soft and enhance the flow of the dress . the fit is true to size and i especially like that it is not too low cut in the front . i will pair it with a light sweater or denim jacket . definitely a dress than can be dressed up or down . very feminine and has a romantic feel ."
__label__0 "i do like the shape of this piece . it is eye catching due to the length and flattering . however if you are chesty this piece shows off more than i was comfy with and i do n't think i 've ever had that problem with retailer . in the body i needed an xs or i would be swimming in it . but up top the xs showed much too much cleavage . ( 34d 5 ' 115 ) . i 'm still keeping it but i have to watch where i wear this ."
__label__0 "facing the mirror -- near perfection . high waist emphasizes the narrowest part of the frame -- pleats nicely hide any stomach flaws . color is an eye-catching deep mustardy perfection and the interlocking button pattern is creative and beautiful . the problem is the walk away . from that view the skirt waist finishes just where there 's a bit of extra flesh . the cut is more of a long a-line -- fairly boxy -- and the heaviness of the cotton maintains that structure so while the look as you approach walking"
__label__1 "i love this jacket . it 's easy to dress up or be casual . the black is more like a very dark grey ."
__label__1 "i love this color blue . when this item went on sale i had to grab it and i 'm glad i did . it feels medium weight to me so i could throw this on on a cool summer night and also in the fall . there is some sparkle to the fabric which i think is really a nice added touch . feels comfortable on and looks adorable ."
__label__1 "this is a beautiful blouse . great colors and detailing - i absolutely love the design in the back . will look great with white skinny jeans . it does run a bit on the short side but i have a long torso and it still works . i waffled between the 6 and 8 ( am usually an 8 and a full b cup ) . in sleeveless tops i really like the arm holes to be snug enough to cover that unattractive part between the underarm and breast so i was considering the 6 but ultimately decided the 8 did so with a bit more comf"
__label__-1 "it 's way more distressed than it looks in the picture and that was a no for me ."
__label__0 "ordered this in xl- i usually am between l and xl . i 'm 5 ' 9 and thought it was cropped boxy and billowy around the midsection that was not flattering . the fabric is light and is less like a blazer more like a cardigan ."
__label__1 "i 've been desperate for a swim cover that covers my arms & back . this one fits nicely -- just a pretty feminine happy summer top that still lets me be leggy . i ca n't see them in the photos but the embroidery detail at the upper part of this top has little mirrors sewn among the dots . very fun ! i 'm 5 ' 5 and when i paired this with jean shorts everything below the crotch was visible -- so perhaps slightly shorter than it appears in the pics ."
__label__0 "i wanted so badly to love this sweater . the colors in the blue motif are fabulous and the yarn is soft and warm . but it does not fit me in a flattering way . i ca n't recommend a size because the s and the m were exactly the same size and fit . the neck is broad and bulky and overwhelming the sleeves have bulky cuffs that come down to my fingers and the sweater slides across my shoulders . i 'm 5 ' 6 . it appeared overstretched and i feared it would only stretch out more over time and not be worth"
__label__0 "cute design for a casual top . however it was a little snug on the bust for a medium . i returned it"
__label__0 "this runs a bit on the large side . i ordered my usual m and had room to spare . the green color was lovely but between the fit and the scratchy fabric this is headed back . too bad !"
__label__1 "lovely dress in bright teal color . the zipper was a bit sticky as the other reviewers had mentioned . unfortunately i sized up ( 6 ) based on past reviews and had to exchange for a smaller size ( 4 ) . the fabric does have a bit of stretch so i 'm really not sure why so many people had sizing issues . this is really a great buy with the current sale . tempted to pick up the red version too ."
__label__1 "great fun pattern . sexy styling . the other reviewers commented on how the trim is white and the body is ivory- i actually liked that . i am 5 ' 4 and 120 lbs . i usually wear a 4 and ordered a medium in this suit . bottom was super small and is sold out in large so i had to return it"

__label__0 "i love the look of this dress and the material - the problem is that when i tried it on the fit was a bit off . it seems that the arm holes hung down way too much and pulled the dress so it is uncomfortable to wear . i do n't think i could have gone down or up a size to make this dress work . it is a shame because i really liked the look of it ."
__label__1 "i received many compliments on this dress . for a maeve dress it did run large . i normally take a 4 or 6 in maeve but with this dress i bought the size 2 and it fits perfect . i am 5 ' 2 and 120 lbs . i have a little belly and this dress hides it well . beautiful colors and nice shape . it also hits at my knee so it is perfect for work ."
__label__1 "this top was very pretty when i got it but i was hoping it would be a bit longer . the v neck design was nice and the fabric very soft . i liked that a simple t shirt was so feminine ."
__label__-1 "before i ordered this i noted the other reviews that said it was sheer but thought i would just wear a layer underneath . unfortunately it was one of the sheerest fabrics i 've ever seen . would love it if it could have been a more substantial fabric . to me it was n't worth the money even on sale ."
__label__1 "i saw this online and said to myself next time you are in the retailer store look for this dress . i am glad i did ! i bought the neutral dress ( off white tan.black ) because i knew it would go with everything and most occasions . i am 5 ' 6 136 pounds the small fit me perfect ! in retailer dresses i am between a small/med . the top of the dress is lined and form fitting which is a plus . the off white coored section does go across the chest so one must wear a neutral colored lined bra even though the to"
__label__1 "this dress is so much prettier in person - the pattern is unique adorable and not over-powering . i 'm an xxs petite and i can wear the dress with flats . ( 5ft ) i think this is versatile enough to wear to work party or a casual wedding . the fit is perfect - hugs at the correct spots . the fabric feels really soft and silky and feels a bit heavy which allows it to drape nicely . overall - i love it ."
__label__1 "i would never have bought this top from the online photo but happily came across in in my local store . i bought it in the hot pink gingham check and it is so cute and fresh . will work well for hot summer days when i may want to wear rolled up sleeves as it is very lightweight and gauzy . i bought my usual xs/0 ( 5 ' 7 32b 115lbs ) and whilst it is looser on me than the model i would still say that it is tts - maybe a little fuller in the back than i would like but i will wear mine partially tu"

__label__1 "i was hesitant to buy this top after reading previous reviews but i love it ! granted i am two months postpartum so i am looking for tops that are airy ( it 's summer in socal ) but cover up my tummy . the material is soft and stretchy and it does have a loose shelf bra type inset -- -so not a real bra but at least something there . i wore a free people bralette with it and it looked perfect ! really happy with this top !"

__label__-1 "based on the strength of the other reviews i thought this sweater would be amazing but i was disappointed . the knit is very thin cheap looking and weak that it wo n't last a season undamaged . it reminds me of a duster i bought 15 years ago at a discount fast-fashion retailer when i was a student . sloppy looking with lots of creases out of the package . collar is odd and the sleeve openings have an annoying flare . the drape is not structured enough -- everything about this screams over priced bath"
__label__0 "this is a beautiful and well-made top ; sadly it just did n't work for me . i 'm 5 ' 1 with a pretty short waist and even on me it was too short . the shortness might 've worked if it was n't as baggy as it was . i do n't mind baggy loose-fitting tops but this was so much so that it was just unflattering ; it looked a bit boxy as well ."
__label__1 "the embroidery is breathtaking . it is more flattering and interesting in person . i would highly recommend it ! . it is true to size figure flattering and unique . the only reason i gave it four stars for quality is because the neck is a little itchy . if you are looking for a show stopper and conversation piece this is it !"
__label__1 "fits true to size . good quality style and length ."

__label__1 "just purchased this in the lilac color in the store in my usual xs size . the cut and shape are very flattering with the waist sitting lower than my natural waist . in person the color looks very different than on the website . it is more a lovely neutral taupe to me . one thing is that the snap at the neck is placed about one half inch off in order for the neckline to lay flat . since this jumpsuit is so cute i decided that this is an easy fix i can do myself ."

__label__1 "this top caught my eye in the store due to the beautiful print and lovely fabric . the photo really does n't do it justice . i happened to have on a pencil skirt when i tried it on and the top looked great with my skirt though i will probably wear it more often with jeans or pants . it 's a stunner !"
__label__-1 "i wanted to like this one .. really but it was just plain sloppy looking . i returned it ."
__label__1 "the color of this dress is sublime . so is the fit . ruching in all the right places . made me feel glamorous . it 's a dress that you can easily wear to a holiday party and then still rock it a couple of days later with a sweater coat vest or cropped jacket . the material feels so nice against the skin too . it 's a must have ."
__label__0 "i love these jeans but they run small . i recommend ordering one size up ."
__label__-1 "i bought a petite medium and the length was right but it fit like a potato sack . it was quite comfortable and did n't look completely terrible from the front but from the side it was terribly unflattering . when i tried it on my boyfriend saw it and said it looked like i was wearing a nightie . i do n't do form-fitting clothing but this was the exact opposite and flared out every which way . it 's got to go back ."
__label__0 "this is indeed a very flattering dress and looks great - unless you move in it . the fabric shows every little lump and bump on your body as you move and clings to tights ( only a little but just enough to make it annoying ) . if you have any jiggle at all i 'd steer clear . would have definitely kept it if the fabric were different because the cut is amazing but alas ."
__label__1 "the picture does n't do it justice . i am wearing it right now with cream pants to work with a cardigan i also purchased from retailer and it looks amazing . the fit is true to size . i am large chested but it fit comfortable ... i did go up a size so it is a little longer than i like but i think if i had picked my normal size it would have been a little too snug at the chest . still looks amazing . i feel very feminine in this blouse . good quality material ."
__label__-1 "i tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger . but it 's basically cut for model-sized people only . it 's short and wide and if you have any boobs at all it 'll make the back pucker . i ca n't imagine this will look good on most women ."
__label__0 "i have mixed feelings on these . i ordered the honey which is a mustard color as shown in the picture . they are true to size cute and comfortable . i washed them the first time with a load of darks and the color ran onto other clothes . plus the pants looked a little streaked in some areas . i 'm not sure if this was a bad lot but back to the store they went ."
__label__1 "i love this dress ! i was trying on some dresses in the store and the sales girl put this one in just for fun . i would have never picked this dress out . i did n't look awesome on the hanger . but i tried it on anyway and i ended up getting two other dresses at that time . but i could n't stop thinking about how much i loved the way i looked and felt in this dress . so i did what any girl would do and bought it online . it took me a while to find it online because the picture on line does n't do the dres"

__label__0 "i agree with some of the other reviewers ; this dress runs very large . when i tried on the xs in my local store i loved the color and thought i could work with it with the right bra or camisole but it was just cut far too low in the front and when i tried it on at home it was just too roomy and not fitted enough . i ordered both an xsp and an xxs today so we will see if they fit better . it is an adoreable design cut and color . it just runs way big so size down if you decide to get it ."
__label__0 "i bought these in the blue . i sized down as other reviewers mentioned going for an xs . i 'm 5 ' 5 and about 130lbs and would usually buy a small . at 5 ' 5 the length was too long for me hitting me below my ankles rather than how shown on the model . strike 1. then i felt the material was pretty thin - strike 2. and lastly they hung a little funny on me rather than being a bit loose like jogging pants should be - strike 3. despite the great sale price these went back !"
__label__1 "excited to get this sweater ! i 'm a 38c and usually wear a size 14 blouse so i ordered an xl as i do n't like clingy sweaters . this was perfect ; fitted but not tight . i 'll be able to wear this with jeans and cute boots for lunches or nice slacks and heels for a dinner date . wish i could 've gotten it for the 25 % off + free s/h but glad i did n't wait - this size was sold out first ."
__label__1 "a really great basic that can be styled a number of ways . i bought it in tan and white and received many compliments on it . the slightly off the shoulder look is really flattering and perfect for a spring or summer look ."

__label__-1 "this dress was too cute to pass up ! i loved it online but when i got it home it was so tight i could n't zip up my normal size . the length was perfect on me being 5 ' 7 . the fabric and detail was beautiful . if you have a bust order a size up . beautiful dress just really snug up top ."

__label__-1 "i love everything from retailer but this top did not fit all that flattering . the neck line fits a little weird . too bad . color was nice though . i returned the top ."
__label__0 "i bought the orange color . i had a hard time styling it as it is so long . since it is a turtleneck and short sleeve you 'll need a jacket or sweater on top . nothing looked right . it has a relatively high and tight neck so sweaters looked weird . short jackets did n't work either . i 'm 5 ' 4 and bought the small . returned it for the charente cowl neck which worked much better"

__label__0 "tried this on in store and it runs very small . i am a size 4 but have curvy hips so i sized up to a size 6 and i could n't even button it . i was hoping it was more of an a-line but it 's fit more like a pencil skirt . not very flattering on my body type . overall cute design but not for me ."
__label__0 "beautiful and versatile dress but shoddy quality . i hand washed ( per the instructions ) it after wearing it once and the sleeves are already falling apart ."
__label__1 "i 'm 5 ' 2 and bought the dress in a petite medium . i like to buy clothes that i can wear to work and this dress was almost too short . if it were any shorter it would n't have worked . if i were to buy it again i 'd probably go with a non-petite size . also i ordered the dress online and i found two snags in it as soon as i pulled it out of the box . i do n't think they will be terribly noticeable but just beware that this dress will apparently snag easily . i plan to wear it with a purse without meta"
__label__0 "disappointed with the fit and color of this sweater . more of a rusty red then bright cherry red . i ordered a small and found the sweater had no shape and just hung lumpy on me . i am 5 ' 5 120 and usually a small in retailer sweaters ."

__label__-1 "this looked so odd on me ! i decided to give it to someone with a different body type and she found it really odd too . the sleeve are a bit too long to be short and they are tight at the bottom . the top is really large as to be unflattering . perhaps it 's just that it does n't work on someone who is petite but this one is a return ."
__label__1 "they fit me great are super comfortable . they are casual yet also stylish thanks to details like the colorful waistband and the zippers on the side of the legs . they looks great and i think i can wear them for many occasions . i love them with booties : ) . i think they look better in person than online too"
__label__-1 "what a shame this dress is . i wear xl and am 5 ' 2 but the dress in the store in the size xs ( ! ! ! ! ! ) looked just the right size . yup ! xs was just the right size . i ca n't imagine anyone who wears m or s finding this dress fit flattering . it would look like a sack . it is an inch or two too short in the front for me so i 'll be returning it ."
__label__0 "i was disappointed with this dress because it is not the usual retailer quality . the quality of the material is not very good . i 've bought boiled wood jackets from this brand before and they 're very soft and very well made hence my disappointment . i agree with the other reviewers in that this dress runs very large and the length is short for a winter dress ."

__label__-1 "i 'm 5 ' 3 and ordered the small . as soon as i saw it in person i knew it was an item to return . the material is too transparent and designed to wear with undergarments or swim gear that you want people to see . it was way too long for me . i think it would work for a taller person . i just did n't feel it was worth the money for the quality and transparency ."
__label__0 "i really wanted to like his dress but it was a big miss . big big miss . look at the way the skirt is attached to the dress in the photo . it goes up high on the sides leaving a short bodice . the sequined patterns hit right at my breasts so it looked like glittery bra cups on the front . the back glittery pattern looked like bird wings on my back . it was far shorter than i expected . overall it looked like i was desperately trying to be a sexy angel or fairy . bad bad bad ."
__label__0 "i tried this on in my usual size and it was tight through the chest because of the lining . i would have preferred to wear a cami beneath and then it may have worked . the color and pattern are gorgeous the fabric feels a bit weird kind of dry and rough ? would have liked to see this in a longer length and more tapered . it is an absolute pregnant top . so sad its so pretty !"
__label__1 "this tank is very loose fitting which i can understand would make some think it runs large . taking into account the fabric and the twisted straps i personally think it would look ridiculous if it was more fitted . i love the draped styling which i also think makes sense with the pattern . it 's an easy top too ... just throw on and go . and the loose fit is perfect for the disgustingly hot and humid summer months here in the midwest ."
__label__0 "this dress is adorable . it simply did not fi off the rack . i invested 15 dollars in alterations to get rid of the very bottom side pockets- why where they even there ? and to shape the bottom . basically the dress is straight all the way down the sides.by up and alter .... the top pattern and cut at the top made the alteration investment worth it to me- the quality of the fabric is excellent . and the pattern is adorable- can be worn as little black dress cocktail party or date night . the top de"

__label__1 "i love this shirt ! it 's such a beautiful striking color yet still simple enough to not take the spotlight . the peekaboo shoulders are totally cute . i bought another one of these when it went on sale . so now i have two just in case ; ) haha"

__label__-1 "loved these in store when i tried them on but was in between sizes so i ordered them in the larger size . boy do i regret that ! these stretch out so much i have to wear a belt with them and it gives me this saggy bunchy front when i sit ... not attractive . wish i could return them but i took the tag off and wore them not knowing this before hand ! ! if in between sizes definitely size down ."

__label__0 "i 'm usually a small ( 5 ' 5 116 lbs long torso ) but the x-small fit well . the black does look see-through in the pictures but i figured i could wear a cami with it . it is see-through in person if you are up close mainly in the back and arms since the front has extra fabric in places . however it is rather short possibly because it is an x-small and i 'll need a short cami to fit under it or will have to have a cami hanging out of the bottom which drapes nicely and a cami may mar that effect"

__label__1 "i * love * this tunic . i 'm 5 ' 5 and can wear it as a dress with bike shorts or leggings . it is so soft and comfortable and i love the pink color -- very versatile . my favorite thing about this piece -- i am a 36dd and have n't bought a button down shirt in years until this tunic which fits over my chest and is so flattering ! many reviewers are saying that this tunic runs large -- i agree but for those of us who are busty it 's an opportunity to wear a cute breezy style with buttons and a collar !"
__label__-1 "i thought this was adorable on the model but not so much on me . i actually did n't mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan but i did n't want to keep it for 1 look . the material felt inexpensive . the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself . i 'm 5 ' 8 and about 160 lbs ."

__label__-1 "this dress would have been gorgeous and consistent with retailer 's aesthetic if the designs had been embroidered onto a thick silk/jacquard fabric to give it texture which is how it looks from the photo . obviously it would have been more expensive but in any case this was just a really expensive polyester dress which it says in the product description but i gave retailer the benefit of the doubt thinking if anyone can make even polyester look like a quality product it 'll be retailer . but now i"

__label__1 "i saw this dress on the cashier at retailer and had to order it . it is as one of the reviewers said like having two dresses in one . the bottom dress is a full dress and the top lays over it not quite skimming but not quite loose either . i love the dress as i am a pear shaped size 14 and this helps to camouflage some bumps nicely . this dress reminds of the dresses some peasant women wear in rural countries ."
__label__1 "i highly recommend this dress ! ! ! ! ! ! i was a little nervous about purchasing this dress online because previous reviewers were saying that it creates static but nothing that a little static guard could n't prevent ! : ) i purchased a medium petite and i am about 5 feet tall usually a size 8 in dresses and it fit perfect !

__label__-1 "i really liked the casual style of this top but i was disappointed when i put it on . it 's cut weird- the shoulder cut-outs are smaller than pictured and just do n't seem to hang right . they do n't hit where they 're supposed to and the sleeves were also not as pictured more like 3/4 which i did n't like . the color is really nice and i liked the fabric but the fit was just off . i tried xs and s. both fit weird ."

__label__1 "i love this top ! although it is a tad big i expected this because the moth brand usually does run a tad big . however i am still able to wear it without any nerves that it 's too big .... hope that makes sense ! the navy was more lovely with my skin + hair but the yellow was so pretty too !"

__label__0 "i love the style and color of this jumpsuit . i ordered a petite and with tall shoes it 's still about 3 too long . the side seam needs to be taken out at the bottom to hem it so that 's a pain in the rear . also this has a side zipper but you step through the neckline to put it on . if any part of me was even a tiny bit larger this would never work . the biggest issue is that it armholes/bust gaps a lot . there should have been a dart from the armhole down towards the bust . i 'm hoping to be"
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this dress - and did from the picture online . when it arrived the black already looked faded and old . also the embroidery looks like a grandma but not in a cute vintage way . the fabric is stiff which causes a boxy unflattering look . had to return it ."

( i even considered ordering the large in this - my normal size at retailer . ) second the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo and the fabric felt cheap . finally it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that did n't fit right ."
__label__1 "first i noticed that the grey was more like a blue-grey/navy which i do n't mind because it 's still a nice unique color . i ordered petite size 26 and although these are very well made/sturdy cords and fit at the ankle like the model pictured the thigh/calves were surprisingly a bit too tight for me ( and my calves are s c r a w n y ) . this cord version does n't seem as stretchy as some of their other styles so i 'm going back for the standard 26 's !"

__label__-1 "i am a sucker for a peasant dress . i love anything i can toss with a pair flats and head out the door but this dress is ridiculous . i look like a schoolmarm . the white bib collar takes this dress into costume territory . i love one september and have many items from the brand that i wear regularly so i 'm bummed that this was n't what i expected . i knew it would have flow but it 's more billowy than i wanted . stay away unless you want to look like a little girl on the first day of school ."

__label__0 "i ordered the pink in size xl . the color was pretty . the problem is the material was too thin and tight . it ran at least a size smaller than shown in the photos online ."
__label__-1 "i feel that for this price i should love this top ( and i wanted to ) . however the price is on the high side for a relatively basic top and there were a few things about it that could be improved . pros : i ordered a medium and feel that it 's pretty true to size . additionally the fabric is nice and light ( but also * sheer * ) and generally speaking has a nice pattern . overall it 's a very pretty top . cons : there 's a cute criss-cross ruffle thing happening in the back but the model has cleverly"
__label__-1 "these pants are more like 9 not 10. i was very dissappointed . the color is great and so is the fabric . if you look more closely at the model the pants do n't fit her either ! ! they are too small ! i have n't decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight . i am a 31 so far but these pants are like a 30. i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer"
__label__0 "super long even at 5 ' 7 and a little too voluminous for my taste . incredibly comfortable and beautiful pattern though . i 'm having a hard time imagining there getting much use for me so even at the sale price they 're going back ."
__label__1 "like the other reviewers said it has a lot of bulky fabric if you wear it as pictured . i tried it on and tied the string around the back so it 's an open vest . i love if !"
__label__-1 "i could n't wait to try this on this sweater . sadly it was too large in all ways . the sleeves are adorable but the ruffle overwhelmed my arms . this was much longer on me than the model . it stopped mid-thigh . the quality seemed fine but it is a thin sweater ."
__label__0 "when i received this tank i ordered the blue i almost returned it because it seemed really thin almost see through . however once i tried it on it had a good fit not see through just lightweight and breezy . i especially like the twisted details on the straps . i would suggest a bralette with a cross back for comfort especially because it is on the thin side ."
__label__1 "i was on the fence about this jumpsuit at first . i feel the pockets in the back are a little high on my bum . kind of an unnatural placement . i sized up so it was n't so tight fitting at the waist and hips so it made the placement of the back pockets a little better ."
__label__-1 "the dress is not the beautiful color in the picture ... it is a very yellowish cream . the fabric is thick and does not hang pretty . very disappointed . had to return it ."
__label__0 "i 'm 5 ' 8 128lbs and bought a size 2. i loved this dress but did n't expect to have to go bra-less or wear a tube top under . the top lands much lower than i expected but the rest of the dress was lovely . i ordered a size 2"
__label__-1 "i bought this shirt in a l since i did n't want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be . it is so boxy ! it 's like a completely different shirt . i have no idea how it looks good on anyone unless it is simply widened the larger the size . maybe a m would n't be as wide and therefore as boxy but this shirt is just a bad mess . returning ."
__label__-1 "beautiful top loved the color but shoulders were totally messed up and not sure if it was from hanging at store or the way it was sewn ."
__label__1 "no size fit me . i 'm normally a s to m. the small had huge armholes on me and the xs was just a wee bit off somehow . perhaps in length . so i ended up without it sadly . it 's really a very nice top and great quality . i was unhappy to leave it behind ."
__label__0 "i bought this sweater online as soon as i saw it . but like the other reviewers i agree it is shapeless and sticks out too much at and below the waist . if it were a softer fabric maybe the flair would work but not for this one . i am 5 ' 2 115lbs 32d and got the xs . maybe if you are n't chesty it wo n't flare out as much . sadly i had to return it . i was so excited for it o well ."
__label__1 "i am a shopper .... i shop a lot . this is one of my favorite dresses of all time ! so unique and as others have said like a piece of art ! the fit is tight through the middle but that 's what makes it look so perfect . i wore with tall brown suede boots and got compliments from ken and women alike . i love it !"
__label__0 "i 'm not in love with this but the husband thinks it looks cute and the sale price is n't bad so i 'm keeping it . i got it in s and am usually an xs or s in retailer tops ( 34b 26 inch waist 120lbs ) . if i had gone with xs it probably would 've been too tight in the shoulders . however i could be 6 months pregnant and you would n't know it . it is very boxy in the torso and i realize the design is for it to be flowy as the back is partially split . but it looks relatively fitted on the model which is"
__label__-1 "it is a beautiful top but runs huge ! ! ! i followed other reviews and ordered a size down hoping it would work but it was totally unflattering ! i wanted so bad to love it but there was no way i could keep it ! !"
__label__0 "the fabric and color of this dress is beautiful . two problems with the dress that the picture does not show . 1. it 's long . i 'm 5 ' 5 . this model must be over 6 feet tall as the length hit 5 inches above my ankle and that is not a flattering length . the other issue is that there is toile underneath making the skirt extra puffy . i 'm 42 and the puffiness reminded me of prom . color and fabric great . but had to send back ."
__label__-1 "this suit was high quality and a cute design . however it is clearly made for a lean body type ."
__label__1 "i could n't believe the bargain price of these leggings so i took a chance and ordered all 3 colors . when they arrived i was equally pleased to see how soft cozy and warm they were and how nice they looked with all my oversized tops . also interesting is that the textures of all 3 are different . the black has a vertical lined texture the lavender has a cable weave texture and the gray is untextured . wearing them is going to be a pleasure !"
__label__-1 "there were just too many pleats to this thing . it was not flattering . it looks fantastic on this model but not on me . oh well ."
__label__1 "i really love this shirt . the cutouts make it unique and the fabric is super soft for a chambray style . i thought the fit was perfect - i 'm 5 ' 5 120lbs and i ordered an xs . still enough room to be comfortable . super cute ! glad i bought it ."
__label__0 "i am a large in knit tees . this is the first tee where the large was just too big . it kind of hung on me . the band across the back also hung down so all over it looked like it was just too big a size for me . the army green turned out to be not a flattering shade of green for me so i returned it . i liked the whole design a lot especially the front macrame part but for me it did not work at all . also too expensive for a tee ."
__label__-1 "this sweater looks great in the picture but when it came in the mail turned out to be enormous . i tried it with a belt on like in the picture but that just made the whole sweater bunch up everywhere . the quality is nice . maybe sizing down would help . but the medium/large is going back . i am normally a medium ."
__label__0 "this top does sit weird feels like a circus outfit ... but at the same time its unique in its own way . i ordered a large and it was true to size in shoulders and chest area but larger and wider waist down probably because of the way this top is styled . i 'm 6ft tall 160 lbs i have curvy body and small chest 34a and i felt that top was a little too cropped for my long torso but i kind of liked it anyway . material is nice and soft for both grey wool and white cotton ."
__label__0 "i ordered this online and i love the style but did n't like the print as much as i thought i would ."
__label__1 "this dress is stunning . i have been stopped in the street by people asking where the dress is from . my only complaint is that it was very wrinkled when i bought it . initially i thought it was supposed to be that way but after seeing the stock photos i realized it needed to be ironed . it took a long time to iron all of the wrinkles out but it is totally worth it ."
